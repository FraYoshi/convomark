  <b>Welcome ${from.first_name}!</b>
  ConvoMark allows to save public Telegram messages (such as those coming from channels and public groups) and store them in named collections, so that they can easily be retrieved later.
  Please run the /help command to get some useful informations about how I work!
  Also remember to check out your <a href="${frontendDomain}">personal dashboard</a>, where you can manage all your bookmarks and collections!

  <b>WARNING</b>
  This bot is experimental and still under heavy development. Expect bugs, crashes and uninplemented features.
  Please report any problem to @convomarksupportbot
help: |
  To start bookmarking conversations simply send me a link to the message. I'll guide you through the next steps.
  You already have a collection called <i>Default</i>, but you can create as many as you want!
  Use the available commands (such as /collections or /collectioncreate) to manage your collections.
  They all start a guided procedure, so you don't have to worry about anything!

  Finally, here are some useful links:
  - Your <a href="${frontendDomain}">personal dashboard</a>
